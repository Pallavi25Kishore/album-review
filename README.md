# Create a CRUD-y Album Review App

## The page should show your reviewed albums on load as well as:
- A title
- A button to add a review

### Each review should include:
- The title of the album
- A rating 1 through 5
- A review comment
- A button to delete the review
- A button to update the review

### Clicking on add a review should open a form with:
- A text input for title
- An input for rating (preferably radio buttons)
- A text for review that is limited to 250 characters
- A submit button
