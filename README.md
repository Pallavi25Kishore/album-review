# Create a CRUD-y Album Review App

## You got this! I believe in you!!!

## On load, you should see all of your reviewed albums as well as:
- A title for the website
- A button to add a review

### Each review should include:
- The name of an album
- A rating 1 through 5
- A review comment
- A button to delete the review
- A button to update the review

### Clicking on ADD A REVIEW should open a form with:
- A text input for the album
- An input for rating (preferably radio buttons)
- A text for review that is limited to 250 characters
- A submit button

#### Create for MongoDB then delete and create for MySQL (then start over!)
#### You will need to update your package.json to watch for changes and install more dependencies
#### Don't forget to create a .env file
#### Do this ten times and then get some sleep!
